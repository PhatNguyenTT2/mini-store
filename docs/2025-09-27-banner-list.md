### Step: Add Banner List after New Arrivals

**Date**: 2025-09-27

### What changed
- **Component added**: `src/components/BannerList.jsx`.
- **Integrated**: Rendered `<BannerList />` right after the "New Arrivals" section in `src/screens/HomeScreen.jsx`.
- **Quality**: Lint clean.

### Files touched
- `src/components/BannerList.jsx` — grid of image banners, responsive columns.
- `src/screens/HomeScreen.jsx` — imported and rendered `BannerList`.

### Design reference
- As per Figma sequence after product grid: [Figma node 6314:2763](https://www.figma.com/design/7BrUGGOPT882iFG4hQJIsh/75--Ecommerce-Landing-Page-Templates--Community-?node-id=6314-2763&m=dev)

### Notes
- Uses the same three banner images as earlier promos to match the design; can be replaced with exact assets if different.

### Next
- Continue with subsequent sections in the design (e.g., more product collections, footer, etc.).
